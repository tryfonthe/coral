3 entities example:
GC-LC-A(gent)
the idea is, if there is no connection with the GC, the LC takes over.
The agent is doing NOTHING. Just runs... (waiting isntructions from LC)

run the agent (A): ./agent
run the local controller (LC): ./local
run the global controller (GC): ./global

they all run the respective *_config.yaml in ./config/localhost

DON'T FORGET:
cd wishful
source ./dev/bin/activate
